# Product Order System 🌟

## Overview 📖

**ProductOrderSystem** is a microservice-based backend system designed to manage products and orders efficiently. This service enables administrators to manage a catalog of products and process orders placed by customers. The architecture is designed to be scalable, fault-tolerant, and event-driven, leveraging modern cloud technologies.

## Features ✨

### User Management 👤

- Secure registration and login for customers.
- Role-based access control (e.g., ADMIN, CUSTOMER).

### Product Management 🛒

- Admins can create, update, delete, and view products.
- Customers can view available products.

### Order Management 📦

- Customers can place orders for products.
- Admins can view and manage orders.

## System Design 🛠️

This service is built with a focus on:

- **Scalability**: Easily handle increased load by scaling horizontally.
- **Fault Tolerance**: High availability with failover mechanisms.
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Asynchronous communication using Apache Kafka.
- **Cloud Deployment**: Leveraging containerization and Kubernetes for seamless deployment.

## System Architecture 🏗️
The architecture of ProductOrderSystem is designed using microservices principles, ensuring scalability, fault tolerance, and modularity. Below is a high-level overview of the architecture:

### Components 📦

1. **API Gateway (Spring Cloud Gateway)**:
    - Handles incoming requests and routes them to the appropriate microservice.
    - Provides load balancing, request throttling, and authentication.

2. **User Service**:
   - Manages user data and authentication.
   - Handles secure login, registration, and role management.

3. **Product Service**:
    - Manages product catalog, including CRUD operations for products.
    - Includes Redis caching for fast product retrieval.

4. **Order Service**:
    - Handles order creation, status updates, and retrieval.
    - Uses event-driven communication to process orders asynchronously.

5. **Apache Kafka**:
    - Manages asynchronous communication between services.
    - Ensures reliable and scalable event handling.

6. **PostgreSQL Database**:
    - Stores relational data, such as user accounts, product details, and orders.

7. **Redis**:
    - Provides caching to improve system performance.

8. **Prometheus and Grafana**:
    - Provides caching to improve system performance.

9. **Docker and Kubernetes**:
    - Ensures consistent environments and scalable deployments.

## System Workflow 🔄
1. A user sends a request (e.g., login, view products, or place an order) via the API Gateway.
2. The request is routed to the respective service (User Service, Product Service, or Order Service).
3. Services communicate asynchronously using Kafka for tasks like order processing.
4. Responses are sent back to the user through the API Gateway.

## System Diagram 🖼️
Below is a representation of the system architecture (replace with the actual diagram later)

## Usage Examples 🛠️
**Example 1**: View Products
1. User sends a GET /products request via the API Gateway.
2. The request is forwarded to the Product Service.
3. The Product Service retrieves data from the cache or PostgreSQL and sends the response back.

**Example 2**: Place an Order
1. User sends a POST /orders request with the product details.
2. The Order Service processes the request and emits an event using Kafka.
3. Other services (e.g., Inventory Service) consume the event to update stock.
